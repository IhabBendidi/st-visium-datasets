  "description": "\n10X Genomics obtained fresh frozen human Invasive Lobular Carcinoma breast tissue from BioIVT Asterand. The tissue was embedded and cryosectioned as described in Visium Spatial Protocols – Tissue Preparation Guide Demonstrated Protocol ([CG000240](/support/spatial-gene-expression-fresh-frozen/documentation/steps/tissue-prep/visium-spatial-protocols-tissue-preparation-guide)). Tissue sections of 10µm were placed on Visium Gene Expression slides and fixed and stained following Methanol Fixation, H&E Staining & Imaging for Visium Spatial Protocols ([CG000160](/support/spatial-gene-expression-fresh-frozen/documentation/steps/tissue-staining/methanol-fixation-hand-e-staining-and-imaging-for-visium-spatial-protocols)).\n\nThe tissue was AJCC/UICC Stage Group I, ER positive, PR positive, HER2 negative.\n\nThe H&E image was acquired using a Nikon Eclipse Ti2-E microscope with the following settings:\n\n- Color camera\n- 10X objective\n- Numerical Aperture: 0.45\n- Exposure: 20 ms\n\nThe Visium Gene Expression library (T1T2-A6) was prepared as described in the Visium Spatial Reagent Kits User Guide ([CG000239](/support/spatial-gene-expression-fresh-frozen/documentation/steps/library-construction/visium-spatial-gene-expression-reagent-kits-user-guide) Rev D). Targeted libraries were prepared following the Targeted Gene Expression - Spatial User Guide (CG000377) using the Human Immunology Panel (PN-2000286). Targeted sequencing data was processed using Space Ranger.\n\n- Sequencing instrument: Illumina NovaSeq 6000, flow cell HHWHLDSXY (lane 4)\n- Sequencing depth: 16,141 mean reads per cell\n- Sequencing configuration: Paired-end (28 X 90), Dual-Indexed Sequencing. Read 1: 28 cycles (16 bp barcode, 12 bp UMI); i7 index: 10 cycles; i5 index: 10 cycles; Read 2: 90 cycles (transcript).\n- Slide: V19L29-095\n- Area: A1\n\nKey targeted metrics were:\n\n- Spots detected: 4,325\n- Median targeted genes per spot: 203\n- Median targeted UMI counts per spot: 672\n- Reads mapped confidently to the targeted transcriptome: 84.2%\n- Total targeted genes detected: 973\n\nTo maintain donor anonymity, sequence data for this sample is not currently available.\n",
