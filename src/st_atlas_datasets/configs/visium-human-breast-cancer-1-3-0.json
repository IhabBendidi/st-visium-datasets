  "description": "10x Genomics obtained fresh frozen Invasive Ductal Carcinoma breast tissue from [BioIVT](https://bioivt.com/ \"https\\://bioivt.com/\"). The tissue was embedded and cryosectioned as described in Visium Spatial Protocols - Tissue Preparation Guide Demonstrated Protocol ([CG000240](/support/spatial-gene-expression-fresh-frozen/documentation/steps/tissue-prep/visium-spatial-protocols-tissue-preparation-guide) Rev A). Tissue sections of 10 µm thickness were placed on Visium Gene Expression Slides.\n\nThe tissue was AJCC/UICC Stage T2N0M0, ER positive, PR negative, Hercep Test 2+.\n\n* Block ID: 1168993F\n* Tumor Grade III\n* Sex: Female (Age 60s)\n* RIN Score: 9.26\n\nThe slide was cover-slipped and the H&E image acquired using a Nikon Ti2-E microscope with the following settings:\n\n* Color camera\n* 20X objective\n* Numerical Aperture: 0.75\n* Exposure: 10 ms\n* Gain: 4.5X\n\nThe library was prepared following the Visium Spatial Gene Expression Reagent Kits User Guide ([CG000239](/support/spatial-gene-expression-fresh-frozen/documentation/steps/library-construction/visium-spatial-gene-expression-reagent-kits-user-guide) Rev A).\n\n* Sequencing instrument: Illumina NovaSeq 600, flow cell H2LJMDSXY (lane 1-3)\n* Sequencing Depth: 47,223 reads per spot\n* Sequencing Configuration: 28 x 120 bp\n* Sequencing Coverage: Read 1 - 16 bp (includes 16 bp Spatial Barcode, 12 bp UMI); Read 2 - 120 bp (transcript); i7 sample index - 10 bp; i5 sample index - 10 bp.\n* Dual-Index set: T1T2-E5\n* Slide: V19B23-014\n* Capture Area: A1\n\nKey cell metrics were:\n\n* Spots detected under tissue - 4,898\n* Median UMI counts per spot - 9,720\n* Median genes per spot - 3,654\n\nTo maintain donor anonymity, sequence data for this sample is not currently available.\n",
