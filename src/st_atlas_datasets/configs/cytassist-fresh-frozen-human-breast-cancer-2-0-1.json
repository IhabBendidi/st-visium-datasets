  "description": "10x Genomics obtained fresh frozen (FF) Human Breast Cancer tissue blocks from [Avaden](http://www.avadenbio.com/) Biosciences. The tissue was sectioned as described in Visium CytAssist Spatial Gene Expression for Fresh Frozen–Tissue Preparation Guide Demonstrated Protocol ([CG000636](/support/spatial-gene-expression-ffpe/documentation/workflows/cytassist-ffpe/steps/tissue-prep/visium-cytassist-spatial-gene-expression-for-fresh-frozen-–-tissue-preparation-guide)). Tissue section of 10 µm was placed on a standard glass slide, and H&E-stained following methanol fixation. Sections were coverslipped with 85% glycerol, imaged, decoverslipped, followed by destaining as described in Visium CytAssist Spatial Gene Expression for Fresh Frozen – Fixation, H&E Staining, Imaging & Destaining Demonstrated Protocol ([CG000614](/support/spatial-gene-expression-ffpe/documentation/workflows/cytassist-ffpe/steps/tissue-staining/visium-cytassist-spatial-gene-expression-for-fresh-frozen-–-methanol-fixation-h-e-staining-imaging-destaining)). The glass slide with tissue section was processed via Visium CytAssist instrument to transfer analytes to a Visium CytAssist Spatial Gene Expression slide with 6.5 mm Capture Area following the Visium CytAssist Spatial Gene Expression Reagent Kits for FFPE User Guide ([CG000495](/support/spatial-gene-expression-ffpe/documentation/workflows/cytassist-ffpe/steps/library-construction/visium-cyt-assist-spatial-gene-expression-reagent-kits-for-ffpe)). RIN Score: 4.4\n\nThe H&E image was acquired using Olympus VS200 Slide Scanning Microscope with these settings:\n\n* Olympus Objective magnification: 20x UPLXAPO Objective\n* Numerical Aperture: 0.8\n* ScopeLED light source: Xcite Novum\n* Camera: VS-264C\n* Exposure: 500 µs\n\nLibraries were prepared following the Visium CytAssist Spatial Gene Expression Reagent Kits for FFPE User Guide ([CG000495](/support/spatial-gene-expression-ffpe/documentation/workflows/cytassist-ffpe/steps/library-construction/visium-cyt-assist-spatial-gene-expression-reagent-kits-for-ffpe)).\n\n* Sequencing instrument: Illumina NovaSeq 6000, flow cell HLYH7DSX5 (lane 1-4)   \n* Sequencing depth: 75,314,377 reads / 15.1% saturation\n* Sequencing configuration: 28bp read 1 (16bp Visium spatial barcode, 12bp UMI), 90bp read 2 (transcript), 10bp i7 sample barcode and 10bp i5 sample barcode\n* Dual-Index set: SI-TS-C9\n* Slide: V42U20-030\n* Area: A1\n\nKey cell metrics were:\n\n* Spots detected under tissue: 1,657\n* Median UMI counts per spot: 27,128\n* Median genes per spot: 6,782",
