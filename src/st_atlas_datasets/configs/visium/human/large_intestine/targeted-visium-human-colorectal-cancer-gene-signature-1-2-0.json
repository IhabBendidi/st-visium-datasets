  "description": "\n10X Genomics obtained fresh frozen Invasive Adenocarcinoma of the large intestine tissue from BioIVT Asterand. The tissue was embedded and cryosectioned as described in Visium Spatial Protocols – Tissue Preparation Guide (Demonstrated Protocol CG000240). Tissue sections of 10µm were placed on Visium Gene Expression slides and fixed and stained following Methanol Fixation, H&E Staining & Imaging for Visium Spatial Protocols (CG000160).\n\nThe tissue was AJCC/UICC T4aN0M0, Stage Group IIB.\n\nThe H&E image was acquired using a Nikon Eclipse Ti2-E microscope with the following settings:\n\n- Color camera\n- 10X objective\n- Numerical Aperture: 0.45\n- Exposure: 20 ms\n\nThe Visium Gene Expression library (T1T2-E8) was prepared as described in the Visium Spatial Reagent Kits User Guide (CG000239 Rev D). Targeted libraries were prepared following the Targeted Gene Expression - Spatial User Guide (CG000377) using the Human Gene Signature Panel (PN-2000285).\nTargeted sequencing data was processed using Space Ranger.\n\n- Sequencing instrument: Illumina NovaSeq 6000, flow cell HHW57DSXY (lane 4)\n- Sequencing depth: 16,795 mean reads per cell\n- Sequencing configuration: Paired-end (28 X 90), Dual-Indexed Sequencing. Read 1: 28 cycles (16 bp barcode, 12 bp UMI); i7 index: 10 cycles; i5 index: 10 cycles; Read 2: 90 cycles (transcript).\n- Slide: V10A13-206\n- Area: C1\n-\n\nKey targeted metrics were:\n\n- Spots detected: 3,138\n- Median targeted genes per spot: 351\n- Median targeted UMI counts per spot: 635\n- Reads mapped confidently to the targeted transcriptome: 88.2%\n- Total targeted genes detected: 1,134\n\nTo maintain donor anonymity, sequence data for this sample is not currently available.\n",
