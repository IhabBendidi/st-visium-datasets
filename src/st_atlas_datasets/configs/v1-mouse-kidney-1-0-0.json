  "description": "\n10x Genomics obtained fresh frozen mouse kidney tissue from [BioIVT](https://bioivt.com) Asterand. The tissue was embedded and cryosectioned as described in Visium Spatial Protocols - Tissue Preparation Guide Demonstrated Protocol ([CG000240](/support/spatial-gene-expression/sample-prep/doc/demonstrated-protocol-visium-spatial-protocols-tissue-preparation-guide)). Tissue sections of 10 µm thickness from a slice of the coronal plane were placed on Visium Gene Expression slides, then stained following the Methanol Fixation, H&E Staining & Imaging Demonstrated Protocol ([CG000160](/support/spatial-gene-expression/sample-prep/doc/demonstrated-protocol-methanol-fixation-hande-staining-and-imaging-for-visium-spatial-protocols)).\n\n* Sex: Male\n* Age: >8 weeks\n* Strain: C57BL/6\n\nThe H&E image was acquired using a Nikon Ti2-E microscope with the following settings:\n\n- Color camera\n- 10X objective\n- Numerical Aperture: 0.45\n- Exposure: 2 ms\n- Gain: 4.5X\n\nThe Visium Spatial Gene Expression libraries were prepared following the Visium Spatial Gene Expression Reagent Kits User Guide ([CG000239](/support/spatial-gene-expression-fresh-frozen/documentation/steps/library-construction/visium-spatial-gene-expression-reagent-kits-user-guide) Rev A).\n\n* Sequencing instrument: Illumina NovaSeq 6000\n* Sequencing depth: 261,122 reads per spot\n* Sequencing configuration: Paired-end (28 X 90), Dual-Indexed Sequencing. Read 1: 28bp read 1 (16bp Visium spatial barcode, 12bp UMI), Read 2: 120bp (transcript), 10bp i7 sample barcode and 10bp i5 sample barcode\n* Dual-index set T1T2-C3\n* Slide: V19L29-096\n* Area: B1\n\nKey cell metrics were:\n\n- Spots detected under tissue: 1,438\n- Median UMI counts per spot: 31,716\n- Median genes per spot: 5,799\n",
