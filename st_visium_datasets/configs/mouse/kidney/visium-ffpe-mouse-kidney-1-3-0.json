  "description": "10x Genomics obtained FFPE mouse kidney tissue from [Adlego](https://adlego.se/) and embedded by [BioIVT](https://bioivt.com). The tissue was sectioned as described in Visium Spatial Gene Expression for FFPE – Tissue Preparation Guide Demonstrated Protocol ([CG000408](/support/spatial-gene-expression-ffpe/documentation/workflows/ffpe-v-1/steps/tissue-prep/visium-spatial-gene-expression-for-ffpe-tissue-preparation-guide)). Tissue sections of 5 µm were placed on Visium Gene Expression slides, then stained following Deparaffinization, H&E Staining, Imaging & Decrosslinking Demonstrated Protocol ([CG000409](/support/spatial-gene-expression-ffpe/documentation/workflows/ffpe-v-1/steps/tissue-staining/visium-spatial-gene-expression-for-ffpe-deparaffinization-hand-e-staining-imaging-and-decrosslinking)).\n\n* Sex: Male\n* Age: >8 weeks\n* Strain: C57BL/6\n* Section Orientation: Sagittal\n\nThe H&E image was acquired using Metafer Slide Scanning Microscope from MetaSystems with these settings:\n\n* Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 20x objective\n* Numerical Aperture: 0.8\n* ScopeLED light source\n* MetaSystems CoolCube 4c camera\n\nLibraries were prepared following the Visium Spatial Gene Expression Reagent Kits for FFPE User Guide ([CG000407](/support/spatial-gene-expression-ffpe/library-prep/doc/user-guide-visium-spatial-gene-expression-reagent-kits-for-ffpe-user-guide) Rev A).\n\n* Sequencing instrument: Illumina NovaSeq, flow cell H2LN2DMXY (lane 1-2)\n* Sequencing depth: 53,993 reads per spot\n* Sequencing configuration: 28bp read 1 (16bp Visium spatial barcode, 12bp UMI), 120bp read2 (transcript), 10bp i7 sample barcode and 10bp i5 sample barcode\n* Dual-Index set: SI-TS-G6\n* Slide: V11A13-021\n* Area: C1\n\nKey metrics were:\n\n* Spots detected under tissue: 3,124\n* Median genes per spot: 7,260\n* Median UMI Counts per spot: 32,310\n",
