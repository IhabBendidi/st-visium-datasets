  "description": "### Overview\n\nThis dataset is provided as part of the [Technical Note: Post-Xenium In Situ Applications: Immunofluorescence, H&E, and Visium CytAssist Spatial Gene Expression (CG000709)](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/in-situ-gene-expression/documentation/steps/assay/post-xenium-in-situ-applications-immunofluorescence-h-e-and-visium-cytassist-spatial-gene-expression). Post-Xenium samples were compared to controls (samples not processed through the Xenium workflow) using 10 µm fresh-frozen (FF) serial sections. \n\n*Click the links on the left panel to toggle the files available for download at the bottom of the page.*\n\n### Biomaterials\n\nMouse brain samples (FF, OCT-embedded) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories.\n\n### Tissue preparation\n\nPrior to the Visium CytAssist Spatial Gene Expression workflow, 10 µm sections were either placed on Superfrost Plus Slides (Fisherbrand, PN 12-550-15) and used as controls (not processed with the Xenium workflow prior to CytAssist), or placed on Xenium slides for Xenium processing (post-Xenium).\n\nFF mouse brain sections used for post-Xenium applications were generated using the [Xenium Mouse Brain Gene Expression Panel](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/in-situ-gene-expression/documentation/steps/panel-design/pre-designed-xenium-gene-expression-panels). For more details on methods, see page 13 of the [Technical Note](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/in-situ-gene-expression/documentation/steps/assay/post-xenium-in-situ-applications-immunofluorescence-h-e-and-visium-cytassist-spatial-gene-expression).\n\n### Library preparation & sequencing\n\nConsult the [Technical Note](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/in-situ-gene-expression/documentation/steps/assay/post-xenium-in-situ-applications-immunofluorescence-h-e-and-visium-cytassist-spatial-gene-expression) for details.\n\n* Probe set: [Mouse Whole Transcriptome](/support/spatial-gene-expression-ffpe/documentation/workflows/cytassist-ffpe/steps/probe-sets/visium-mouse-transcriptome-probe-set-v1-0) \n* Slides: 11 mm, V52Y23-098 (Replicate 1), V52Y23-099 (Replicate 2) \n* Areas: A1 (control), B1 (post-Xenium)\n* Sequencing instrument: Illumina NovaSeq 6000\n* Sequencing configuration: 28 bp read 1 (16 bp Visium spatial barcode, 12 bp UMI), 90 bp read 2 (probe insert), 10 bp i7 sample index and 10 bp i5 sample index\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe resulting FASTQ files and image data were analyzed with Space Ranger v2.1 to produce the output files below. \n\n### How to view data\n\nInput and output files are listed below.
